General Utility Functions for Pyvider Telemetry.

This module serves as a collection point for miscellaneous utility functions
that support the `pyvider-telemetry` package. These functions are typically
general-purpose helpers that do not logically fit within the more specialized
modules such as `config`, `core`, or `logger`.

Currently, this module acts as a placeholder. As the library evolves,
any reusable helper functions, data manipulation routines, or other
auxiliary code that aids multiple parts of the telemetry system
may be placed here.

Examples of potential future utilities:
- Helper functions for sanitizing log data.
- Common data transformation or validation logic for telemetry events.
- Small, reusable classes or constants that don't warrant their own module.
