# Development Process Disclosure

## AI-Assisted Development

This project was developed using AI-assisted code generation tools while maintaining human control over all critical technical decisions.

### Human Responsibilities
- **Architecture & Design**: All structural decisions, design patterns, and module organization
- **Requirements Definition**: Feature specifications, API design, and acceptance criteria
- **Quality Assurance**: Code review, testing verification, and performance validation
- **Technical Direction**: Technology choices, dependency selection, and release decisions
- **Functionality Verification**: End-to-end testing and behavior validation

### AI Assistance Scope
- **Code Implementation**: Writing code based on human-defined specifications
- **Documentation Generation**: Creating docstrings, comments, and user documentation
- **Test Development**: Generating test cases based on human-defined test strategies
- **Boilerplate Creation**: Repetitive code structures and configuration files
- **Example Development**: Sample scripts and usage demonstrations

### Development Workflow
1. **Human**: Define requirements, architecture, and acceptance criteria
2. **AI**: Generate implementation code following human specifications
3. **Human**: Review, test, and validate all generated code
4. **AI**: Refactor and improve based on human feedback
5. **Human**: Final approval and integration

### Quality Assurance
All code has been:
- Reviewed by human developers for correctness and design quality
- Tested for functionality and performance requirements
- Validated against architectural and security standards
- Benchmarked for performance characteristics

This development approach leverages AI capabilities for productivity while ensuring human oversight of all critical technical decisions and maintaining full accountability for the final product quality.
